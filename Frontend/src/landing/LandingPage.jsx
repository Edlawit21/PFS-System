                  collaboration among healthcare professionals, pharmacy

                    1. Doctor:
                  </h1>{" "}
                  The Doctor plays a vital role in patient care by prescribing
                  medications directly within the system. They can efficiently
                  generate QR codes for prescriptions, making it easier for
                  pharmacists to retrieve necessary medication details, reducing
                  errors and enhancing patient safety.

                  The Pharmacy Manager oversees the registration of pharmacies
                  and manages available medications. They ensure that inventory
                  is accurately displayed, empowering patients to find the
                  medications they need quickly. Their role is crucial in
                  facilitating smooth operations and effective communication
                  between pharmacists and healthcare providers.

                  Pharmacists are the backbone of the system, responsible for
                  executing sales based on prescriptions. With the ability to
                  scan QR codes and access medication information swiftly, they
                  can provide prompt and accurate service to patients, enhancing
                  the overall healthcare experience.
